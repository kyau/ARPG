Action RPG UI is based on art from Diablo 3 and heavily based on [RothUI](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info9175-RothUIDiablo.html) with inspirations from Path of Exile.

:warning: *ARPG is a work-in-progress, all configuration is currently hard-coded (this means editing Lua is required to reposition/change anything)*

## Required AddOns
All of the following addons are integral to getting the UI setup properly. Unlike other UI packs I have chosen not to hardcode my modifications to these. This means that if ARPG does make changes to these addons it does so in a modular way, meaning you can always run the official versions of these addons.

## Attribution / Credits
Many AddOns have helped me in the development of the ARPG UI. Many AddOns have also been merged/integrated with ARPG. I have tried to give credit for all the borrowed/integrated code here. If you find something that is not in the list that needs to be, please let me know!

* AutoLootPlus (fast loot code)
* AzeriteTooltips (integrated into my tooltips)
* Coordinates (fixing my InfoStrings coords errors)
* DejaCharacterStats/Light&Shadow ElvUI (CharacterArmory/StatsPane stuff)
* Gallywix Azerite Ledger (vital to the creation of my Azerite LDB)
* Ara Broker Money/Friends&Guild converted to "ARPG: Money" and "ARPG: Social" LDB plugins
* VisionBossMod (slowly I am integrated most stuff from here, sans the boss mod, into ARPG)
* Zork for his many many many addons that I have modified and converted from the old RothUI to work with BFA and ARPG
